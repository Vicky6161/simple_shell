Task 0: The goal is to write code that adheres to the Betty style guide, which is a set of rules for writing clean and easy-to-read C code. The code should pass the checks outlined in the guide and be visually appealing.

Task 1: The goal is to create a simple UNIX command line interpreter. The interpreter should display a prompt and wait for the user to input a command, which should be a single word with no arguments or advanced features such as pipes or redirections. The interpreter should handle errors and display an error message if an executable cannot be found. Additionally, the interpreter should handle the "end of file" condition, which occurs when the user enters Ctrl+D.
